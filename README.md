## Overview

Pong Game v0.1 is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python, providing an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience. This project consists of four essential Python files: `main.py`, the central orchestrator of the game; `ball.py`, handling the ball's movement and collision logic; `paddle.py`, defining the behavior of the paddles; and `score.py`, managing the scoring system for an engaging gameplay session. Dive into the world of Pong with this simple yet entertaining Python implementation.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main game file that orchestrates the Pong game.
- `ball.py`: Contains the implementation of the Ball class, including its movement and collision logic.
- `paddle.py`: Implements the Paddle class, defining the behavior of the paddles.
- `score.py`: Manages the scoring system for the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the Pong game.
2. Use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to control the left paddle.
3. Use 'w' and 's' keys to control the right paddle.
4. The game continues until you decide to exit.
